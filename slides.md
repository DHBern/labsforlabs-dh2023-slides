From a devs view:
What are differences in the daily business?

- Emphasis on education and passing on knowledge even for devs
- Much wider range of projects: Devs come in contact with a wide range of fields and need to be really flexible in their communication and problem solving skills
- Often more restrictive in a technological view. (Hosting has to be internal...)
- Often not as much time pressure

--> demand creativity

Perfect Environment for devs
What's needed that developers enjoy working in the academia and stay?

- contracts for 4+ years
- freedom of doing their work where, when and how it fits them the best
  - flexible working hours
  - working from home possible
  - free choice of tools
- ecouragement in passing on their expertise
- Tasks are organised together with superiors

--> support creativity

Perfect Environment for the academia
We can significantly improve performance and quality of digital projects in labs.

- a team of experts in different fields is working together
- this symbiosis enables people to do what they do best
- even smaller projects can get hold of this team
- the lab can be better organized and therefore more efficiant than single developers

--> Strife for specialization

---

Organization
We have a lot of opportunities to develop workflows that streamline our work and make it less repetitive, more fun and better quality.

- organize work through Github Projects, Jira, or other organization tools
- divide a project into milestones, milestones into tasks
- clearly describe milestones and components of the product - all stakeholders have seen these descriptions and agree with it
- set timeframes for each task and milestone
- define a responsable person per task

--> Adopt agile workflow
