## Who's talking?

Sebastian Flick

I'm a frontend developer at [DSL](https://www.dsl.unibe.ch/) and [DH Bern](https://www.dh.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) at the University of Bern, Switzerland.

I studied Philosophy, Linguistics and Computer Science but have also worked in the Industry for several years.

## From a dev's view:

What are differences in the daily business? (**Roles and recognition**)

- Emphasis on education and passing on knowledge even for devs
- Much wider range of projects: Devs come in contact with a wide range of fields and need to be really flexible in their communication and problem-solving skills
- Often frustrating organizational and technological bounds.
- Often not as much time pressure

## Perfect Environment for devs

What's needed that developers enjoy working in the academia and stay? (**Roles and recognition**)

- contracts for 4+ years
- freedom of doing their work where, when and how it fits them the best
  - flexible working hours
  - working from home possible
  - free choice of tools
- Encouragement in passing on their expertise
- Tasks are organized together with superiors

## Perfect Environment for the academia

We can significantly improve performance and quality of digital projects in labs. (**Good practices in lab management**)

- a team of experts in different fields is working together
- this symbiosis enables people to do what they do best
- possibility to employ Junior Devs
- even smaller projects can get hold of this team
- the lab can be better organized and therefore more efficient than single developers

## Organization (**Lab lifecycles, Good practices in lab management**)

We have a lot of opportunities to develop workflows that streamline our work and make it less repetitive, more fun and better quality.

- organize work through GitHub Projects, Jira, or other organization tools
- divide a project into milestones, milestones into tasks
- clearly describe milestones and components of the product - all stakeholders have seen these descriptions and agree with it
- set timeframes for each task and milestone
- define a responsible person per task

<div class="emphazise">--> Adopt agile workflow</div>
